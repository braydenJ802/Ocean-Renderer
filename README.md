# Ocean Renderer
 This is an attempt to convert the Ocean URP code from https://github.com/gasgiant/Ocean-URP and https://github.com/gasgiant/FFT-Ocean written by gasgiant (Jump Trajectory on Youtube) for the Unity Game Engine into a usable form in Godot 4.2+. We will make modifications as needed in order to make it fit our own style.

Some code has also been taken from: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/tree/master/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/ShaderLibrary

Here is a link to a google sheet where we are keeping track of the progress: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13rqcbkKlsGvMub1wRAN0Syi0bDxWGZFyTTXQW1_00e8/edit?usp=sharing
